## Task 1:  
1) What do you mean by Git and GitHub?  
**Ans:-** Git is a distributed version control system which will keep track of changes made in source code. You can commit, make branch without interacting with server. Git is free, easy to use and open source and offers trunk based development.  
GitHub is web based hosting service for git repository to bring team together. It is graphical interface and a development platform created for millions of developers. It is mainly used for open source contribution. It supports all programming languages.

2) Why GitHub is so popular and used in most of the projects?  
**Ans:-** a. It provides secure cloud storage for source code.  
b. It keeps track of all the changes made in source code.  
c. It separates private and public repositories.

3) What is a version control system? How Git is a VCS?  
**Ans:-** When changes are made in source code then VCS keep track of it and with VCS you can switch from current version to any previous version or vice versa and git also works in similar way so it is VCS.

4) What are the other platforms similar to GitHub?  
**Ans:-** a. Gitlab  
b. Bitbucket  
c. SourceForge  
d. launchpad  
e. Google Cloud source Repositories

5) Why are you interested in learning of Git and GitHub?  
**Ans:-** I am interested in learning because I want to manage all those projects which I have created or will create in future using git or github as well as I want to know more about open source contribution where knowledge of git and github is must.

## Task 2:  
1) What do you understand by repository, in context to git?  
**Ans:-** Git is a program that keeps the history of changes. Git repository is .git/ folder which keeps the history of changes we have made till now (i.e. add, commit, remove etc.). This .git/ subfolder is installed in our working directory by git init command.

2) How does git work? Share with us its whole workflow in most precise way possible?  
**Ans:-** There are four stages: a. Working directory (Unmodified) b. Staging c. Local repo d. Remote repo  
i) Suppose we create files in working space and add some content in them means files are in Unmodified stage.  
ii) git add or git add . command files are moved to Staging area means they are now ready for being committed.  
iii) git commit command files are now saved/committed to local repository.  
iv) git push command we are sending those committed files in local repo to server (i.e. remote repo).  
v) git pull command copy of project in remote repo. is moved to working directory.  
vi) git fetch command brings that copy of project remote repo. to local repo. but not in working directory and  
vii)git merge command will bring that copy of project from local repo to working directory.  
viii)git diff command will give differences or changes made by comparing staged file and working file whereas git diff HEAD command will give differences between file in local repo and working file.

3) link of repository you created and pushed your project in
